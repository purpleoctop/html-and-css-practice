        <p>Anthony just returned from Vancouver, where he was covering the TED2019 conference — a much-parodied gathering where VCs, executives and other bigwigs gather to exchange ideas.</p>
        <p>This year, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey got the biggest headlines, but the questions raised in his onstage interview kept popping up throughout the week: How has social media warped our democracy? How can the big online platforms fight back against abuse and misinformation? And what is the Internet good for, anyway? <b>Wednesday at 11:00 am PT </b>, Anthony will recap the five-day event’s most interesting talks and provocative ideas with Extra Crunch members on a conference call.</p>
        <p>Tune in to dig into what happened onstage and off and ask Anthony any and all things media.</p>
