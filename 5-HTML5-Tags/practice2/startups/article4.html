<p>Startups often set themselves back a year by hiring the wrong growth marketer.</p>
<p>This post shares a framework my marketing agency uses to source and vet high-potential growth candidates.</p>
<p>With it, early-stage startups can identify and attract a great first growth hire.</p>
<p>It’ll also help you avoid unintentionally hiring candidates who lack broad competency. Some marketers master 1-2 channels, but aren’t experts at much else. When hiring your first growth marketer, you should aim for a generalist.</p>
<p>This post covers two key areas:</p>

    <li>How I find growth candidates.</li>
    <li>How I identify which candidates are legitimately talented.</li>

<h3><b>Great marketers are often founders</b></h3>
<p>One interesting way to find great marketers is to look for great <i>potential founders.</i></p>
<p>Let me explain. Privately, most great marketers admit that their motive for getting hired was to gain a couple years’ experience they could use to start their own company.</p>
<p>Don’t let that scare you. Leverage it: You can sidestep the competitive landscape for marketing talent <b>by recruiting past founders whose startups have recently failed.</b></p>
<p>Why do this? Because great founders and great growth marketers are often one and the same. They’re multi-disciplinary executors, they take ownership and they’re passionate about product.</p>
<p>You see, a marketing role with sufficient autonomy mimics the role of a founder: In both, you hustle to acquire users and optimize your product to retain them. You’re working across growth, brand, product and data.</p>
<p>As a result, struggling founders wanting a break from the startup roller coaster often find transitioning to a growth marketing role to be a natural segue.</p>
<p>How do we find these high-potential candidates?</p>
