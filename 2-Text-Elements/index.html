    <h1><b>Development</b></h1>
    <p>In 1980, physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a> , a contractor at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERN">CERN</a> , proposed and prototyped <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ENQUIRE">ENQUIRE</a> , a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet">Internet</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext">hypertext</a> system.</p>

<h1><b>January 14, 1997</b></h1>
<p><b>HTML</b> 3.2 was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the <b>W3C</b>, as the <b>IETF</b> had closed its <b>HTML Working Group</b> on September 12, 1996.
  â€‹Initially code-named "Wilbur", <b>HTML</b> 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. <b><i>Netscape's blink</i></b> element and <b><i>Microsoft's</i></b> marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.</p>
<p>A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that in HTML was not standardized until 14 months later in MathML.</p>
